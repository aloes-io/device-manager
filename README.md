# Aloes - Device Manager

- Replicate devices with rich semantic properties
- Authentification by access tokens and API keys
- Handle devices and sensors CRUD methods triggered via HTTP and MQTT
- MQTT events generated by HTTP operations hooks
- Dispatch MQTT payload from several protocol sources
- Adding context to sensors with OMA schemas
- Store devices and sensors state ( MongoDB )
- Fast access to sensor resources ( Redis )
- Interact with external application and share selection of devices
- Automatically store sensors value in timeseries ( InfluxDB ), in file, or trigger some timers

## Prerequisites

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- Install [Redis](https://redis.io/)

- Install [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)

- Install [Skyring](https://github.com/esatterwhite/skyring) to use external timers

## Folder structure

- /. --> Main application configuration, dependencies list, and launch scripts

- /bin --> contains some maintenance scripts - not needed yet

- /deploy --> contains environment variables ( hidden files )

- /log --> contains logs from PM2

- /storage --> contains folders where users files are stored

- /src --> contains source code
  - /. --> Loopback configuration
  - /boot --> code executed at application start
  - /initial-data --> JSON datasets to make global application running
  - /middleware --> scripts used in development/staging only
  - /mixins --> add special properties to models
  - /models --> REST API descriptions and controllers
  - /services --> external modules
  - /views --> templates used for automatic mailing

## HTTP API

URL pattern : +apiRoot/+modelPluralName/+path

Access controlled by Access tokens ( set in headers ) properties and roles for Users, and apiKey for Applications and Devices.

## MQTT API

Topic pattern : +userId/+modelName/+method/[+modelId]

Access controlled by ( set in mqtt password ) Access tokens for Users, and apiKey for Applications and Devices.

## Configuration

Edit your config in .env_sample and save it as `.env`.
You can override these by populating `deploy` with files corresponding to an environment ( eg: .env_production ... ), and via pm2 `ecosystem.config.json` .

## Installation

```bash
  $ npm install
```

## Linting

```bash
  $ npm run lint
```

## Running the development server

```bash
  $ npm run start:dev
```

## Debug

```bash
  $ DEBUG=loopback npm run start:dev
```

[More info...](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Setting-debug-strings.html)

## Deploying project

Please remember to update `.env` and `ecosystem.config.js` files to match your enviroment.

For example to run in local mode, create `./deploy/.env_local` using `.env_sample` as an example.

```bash
  $ npm run start:local
```

### With PM2 :

- [Documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/deployment/)

- Access to server with SSH :

```bash
  $ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/server_name -t rsa -C <email_address> -b 4096
  $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/server_name user@server_uri
```

- Install PM2 globally :

```bash
  $ npm install -g pm2
```

- Creating environment :

```bash
  $ pm2 deploy ecosystem.config.js production setup
```

- Updating environment :

```bash
  $ pm2 deploy ecosystem.config.js production update
```

Be sure to commit your changes on the right branch before each setup and update: ( master for production env, and staging for dev/staging env )

```bash
  $  git checkout master
  $  git add .
  $  git commit .
  $  git push
```

### With Docker

You can serve the project with a distant server by filling `deploy` folder with files corresponding to an environment ( eg: .env_docker ), and then launching this app with docker via `docker-compose up`

Remember to update `*.dockerfile` to match your enviroment, if you don't use docker-compose.

Creating environment :

```bash
  $  npm run build:docker
```

Starting container :

```bash
  $  npm run start:docker
```

## To deploy with your own TLS / SSL certificates

Read https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_ssl

## To deploy with Localtunnel

Install your own instance : https://github.com/localtunnel/server

And then install wildcards certificates with : https://certbot.eff.org/

Finally, configure TUNNEL_HOST and TUNNEL_SECURE in your environment files.

## TODO

- E2E tests (https://marc-ed-raffalli.github.io/en/projects/lb-declarative-e2e-test)
- Improve file model access and backup
- Update / improve device search engine
- Finish account linking with github
- Add user(s) in a team to easily share devices access ( via collaborators property )
- Data exports ( devices selection by filter )
- Catch and store data related to MQTT traffic ( via Specific sensor instance ? )
